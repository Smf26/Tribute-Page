          politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. 
          A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African American to be elected to the 
          presidency. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an 
          Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.
          In June 1989, Obama met Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the 
          Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin. Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's 
          adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his 
          initial requests to date. They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, 
          and were married on October 3, 1992. After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in 
          vitro fertilisation to conceive their children. The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, 
          was born in 1998, followed by a second daughter, Natasha ("Sasha"), in 2001.

          School.The Obamas have two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift 
          from Senator Ted Kennedy.

          Regarded as a centrist New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his 
          first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the Patient Protection 
          Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the "Affordable Care Act" or "Obamacare"), 
          the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell 
          Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax Relief, 
          Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic 
          stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, 
          he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, 
          he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the 
          United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. 
          He ordered military involvement in Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi, 
          who was killed by NATO-assisted forces. He also ordered the military operations that 
          resulted in the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni Al-Qaeda operative Anwar 
          al-Awlaki.

          After winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for 
          a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. 
          His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage 
          bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage 
          was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in Obergefell. He advocated for gun 
          control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on 
          assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. 
          In foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after 
          the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan 
          in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, 
          initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian 
          interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, 
          and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: 
          Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland faced partisan 
          obstruction and was not confirmed. During his term in office, America's reputation abroad 
          significantly improved.

          Obama spoke in front of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the 
          first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase 
          economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in 
          education, infrastructure, and economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders 
          who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and 
          ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, 
          to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans. During his July 2015 trip, 
          Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.
          Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency 
          among torians, political scientists, and the general public place him among the upper tier 
          of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently 
          resides in Washington, D.C .A December 2018 Gallup poll found Obama to be the most admired 
          man in America for an unprecedented 11th consecutive year, although Dwight D. Eisenhower 
          was selected most admired in twelve non-consecutive years
